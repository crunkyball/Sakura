Drop SDL for GLFW as I really only want windowing and input.

Fix the threaded renderer so that important jobs don't have to clear the non-important job queue. 
Do this by adding an intermediate "dying" state.

Severely reduce (or remove) the members in the RenderJob as it'll cause a lot of cache misses.
Add a render memory buffer and all job data can be pushed and popped into that as needed.

Add lock-free support to the threading library. Currently all asynchronous data structures block.

Add render target support.

Add deferred rendering support.

Add different light types. Point, directional, spotlight.
