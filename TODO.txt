Severe lack of const in SaNet!

--- Below is old... may still be relevant but as it's been over 10 years the whole thing needs analysing.

Fix the threaded renderer so that important jobs don't have to clear the non-important job queue. 
Do this by adding an intermediate "dying" state.

Severely reduce (or remove) the members in the RenderJob as it'll cause a lot of cache misses.
Add a render memory buffer and all job data can be pushed and popped into that as needed.

Add lock-free support to the threading library. Currently all asynchronous data structures block.

Add render target support.

Add deferred rendering support.

Add different light types. Point, directional, spotlight.
